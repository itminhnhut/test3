                                All Users must apply for a Nami.Exchange Account before using Nami.Exchange Services. When you register a Nami.Exchange Account,
                                you must provide your email address and password, and accept these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and other Nami.Exchange Platform

                                lên trọng tài theo đoạn 2 của Phần này, bên dưới. Để tránh nghi ngờ, việc gửi tranh chấp cho Nami.Exchange để giải quyết nội bộ
                                và gửi Thông báo khiếu nại cho Nami.Exchange là những điều kiện tiên quyết để bắt đầu một thủ tục trọng tài (hoặc bất kỳ thủ tục
